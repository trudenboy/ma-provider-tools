# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Use GitHub's built-in [Private Vulnerability Reporting](../../security/advisories/new) to report security issues confidentially.

This ensures the issue can be assessed and a fix prepared before any public disclosure.

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fix (optional)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a fix timeline within 7 days.
